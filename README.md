# javascript-code-quiz-challenge
An online timed Javascript quiz
### User Guide

To start the quiz, hit "Start" on the landing page.  The timer in the top right will display how much time the
user has remaining. For each question select one of the multiple-choice answers.  Selecting an incorrect answer will subtract 10 seconds from the timer. Failure to complete the quiz in time will submit the answers they have already provided.

Once you complete the quiz you are given a percentage score based on how many correct answers they were able to provide within the time limit. You then enter your initials to submit your high score.  After submitting you are taken to the high score page, where your score is displayed alongside those of anyone else who played on the given browser; you can also go to this page by selecting, "View Highscores" at the top.  You can then go back to the main page by hitting, "Go Back," or, "View Highscores," or you can clear high score list using the button that says, "Clear Highscores."
